## Detailer Configuration
- All detailer calls to GitHub repositories must use `ginylil-tech` as the user
- When making detailer calls, always specify the user as `ginylil-tech` in repository URLs
- Example: Use `https://github.com/ginylil-tech/repo-name` instead of other user accounts

## Path Handling
- Never print or display full absolute paths
- Always convert paths to be relative to the home directory (`~`)
- Use `~` prefix for home directory references
- Example: `/Users/username/project/file.txt` should be displayed as `~/project/file.txt`

## Implementation Notes
- Apply these rules consistently across all detailer operations
- Ensure path conversions happen before any output or logging
- Maintain the same functionality while following these display conventions
