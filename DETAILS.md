## 1. Project Overview

### Purpose & Domain
**python-console-snake** is a classic Snake game implemented entirely in Python for the console/terminal environment. It provides an interactive, text-based gaming experience where the player controls a snake to collect apples, grow in length, and avoid collisions with boundaries or itself.

- **Problem Solved:**  
  Offers a lightweight, terminal-based entertainment game that runs cross-platform without graphical dependencies beyond the terminal.
  
- **Target Users & Use Cases:**  
  - Terminal users and Python enthusiasts seeking a nostalgic Snake game experience.  
  - Developers looking for a simple example of game loop, input handling, and curses-based rendering in Python.  
  - Educational use for learning modular Python design, game programming basics, and terminal UI.

- **Core Business Logic & Domain Models:**  
  - **Snake**: Represented as a list of coordinate tuples, modeling the snake‚Äôs body segments.  
  - **Apples**: Positioned randomly within the game area, consumed by the snake to grow and score points.  
  - **Game State**: Includes direction, score, lives, game over conditions, and stage boundaries.  
  - **Controls**: Keyboard input mapped to directional commands and game control (quit, restart).  
  - **Themes & Stages**: Visual styling and terminal layout configurations.

| **Game Logic (Model)**| Core game state and rules                      | `snake/game.py`                     |
| **Game Loop (Controller)**| Timing, input handling, game state updates | `snake/gameloop.py`, `snake/controls.py` |
| **Rendering (View)** | Terminal UI rendering and display               | `snake/graphics.py`, `snake/theme.py`, `snake/themes.py` |
| **Configuration**   | Constants, key mappings, CLI parsing             | `snake/config.py`, `snake/parser.py` |
| **Stage/Layout**    | Terminal size, game area, padding calculations   | `snake/stage.py`, `snake/console.py` |
| **Utilities & Helpers**| Terminal environment utilities                 | `snake/console.py`                  |
| **DevOps & Scripts**| Build, run, tutorial, and development utilities | `Makefile`, `menu.py`               |

### Component Relationships & Data Flows

- The **entry point** (`snake/__main__.py` or `snake/run.py`) initializes configuration, stage, theme, graphics, and game loop modules.
- The **game loop** (`gameloop.py`) drives the update-render cycle, invoking:
  - `controls.update()` to process user input,
  - `game.update()` to update game state,
  - `graphics.update()` to render the current frame.
- The **game module** (`game.py`) manages the snake‚Äôs position, apple spawning, collision detection, and scoring.
- The **graphics module** (`graphics.py`) uses `curses` to draw the game area, snake, apples, and UI elements.
- The **theme modules** (`theme.py`, `themes.py`) provide color and tile character mappings for visual styling.
- The **stage module** (`stage.py`) calculates terminal and game window sizes, padding, and boundaries based on user options and terminal capabilities.
- The **controls module** (`controls.py`) reads keyboard input and translates it into game commands.
- The **parser module** (`parser.py`) handles command-line arguments to customize game size, theme, and fullscreen mode.

### Entry Points & Execution Paths

- Primary execution via:
  ```bash
  python -m snake
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  python snake/run.py
  ```
- `snake/__main__.py` contains the `run()` function which bootstraps the game and starts the main loop.
- `menu.py` provides an interactive tutorial and launcher script that can invoke the game with different options.
- `Makefile` offers various commands for running, testing, and development tasks.

### Key Interfaces & Data Structures

- **Game State:**
  - `snake`: List of `(x, y)` tuples representing snake segments.
  - `apples`: List of `(x, y)` tuples representing apple positions.
  - `direction`: Tuple `(dx, dy)` indicating current movement vector.
  - `score`, `lives`, `state`: Numeric and enum-like variables tracking game progress.

- **Configuration:**
  - `keys`: Dictionary mapping control names to key codes (e.g., arrow keys, WASD).
  - `frame_len`: Float controlling game loop frame duration.
  - `apple_domain`, `food_values`: Numeric constants defining apple spawn area and scoring.

- **Theme:**
  - `game_themes`: Dictionary of themes, each with `colors` and `tiles`.
  - Color pairs mapped to curses color pairs for terminal rendering.

- **Stage/Layout:**
  - Terminal width and height.
  - Game window size, padding, and boundaries.

### Communication Patterns

- Modules communicate via direct imports and shared global state within the package.
- The game loop (`gameloop.py`) acts as the orchestrator, invoking update and render functions.
- Input is polled synchronously in the game loop via `controls.update()`.
- Rendering is done via `graphics` using curses, updated every frame.
- Configuration and options flow from `parser` and `config` into `stage` and other modules.

---

## 4. Dependencies & Integration

### External Libraries

- **Python Standard Library:**
  - `curses`: Terminal UI rendering and color management.
  - `os`, `fcntl`, `termios`, `struct`: Terminal environment and input handling.
  - `random`: Random apple spawning.
  - `math`: Calculations for layout and boundaries.
  - `time`: Game loop timing.
  - `subprocess`: Used in `menu.py` for launching game and help commands.

### Internal Dependencies

- Modules within `snake/` import each other to separate concerns:
  - `__main__.py` imports `parser`, `stage`, `graphics`, `theme`, `game`, `gameloop`, `controls`.
  - `gameloop.py` depends on `graphics`, `game`, `controls`.
  - `graphics.py` depends on `theme`, `stage`.
  - `stage.py` depends on `console`, `config`, `parser`.
  - `theme.py` depends on `themes`, `stage`.

### Database or Storage

- No persistent storage or database integration; game state is ephemeral in memory.

### API Dependencies

- No external APIs; all functionality is local and terminal-based.

### Build and Deployment Dependencies

- No complex build system; uses a `Makefile` for convenience.
- Runs on Python 3 with standard libraries.
- Requires a terminal supporting curses (Unix-like terminals, Windows with appropriate support).

---

## 5. Development Patterns and Standards

### Code Organization Principles

- Modular design with single responsibility per module.
- Clear separation of concerns: input, game logic, rendering, configuration.
- Use of package namespace `snake` to encapsulate game code.
- Entry points (`__main__.py`, `run.py`) separate from core logic.

### Testing Strategies and Coverage

- No explicit test files or frameworks detected.
- Testing likely manual or via running the game.
- Potential to add unit tests for `game.py` logic and CLI parsing.

### Error Handling and Logging

- Minimal explicit error handling; relies on Python exceptions.
- Graceful shutdown on `KeyboardInterrupt` in `run.py` and `__main__.py`.
- No logging framework detected; could be enhanced for debugging.

### Configuration Management

- Static configuration constants centralized in `config.py`.
- CLI options parsed in `parser.py` to override defaults.
- Themes and stage layout dynamically configured at runtime.

## 6. Usage and Operational Guidance

### Running the Game

- Run the game via:
  ```bash
  python -m snake
  ```
- Alternatively:
  ```bash
  python snake/run.py
  ```
- Use the `Makefile` targets for convenience:
  - `make run` to start the game.
  - `make run-debug` for debug mode.
  - `make run-full` for fullscreen mode.

### Controls

- Arrow keys or WASD to move the snake.
- Specific keys to quit or restart (defined in `config.py` keys mapping).

### Customization

- Command-line options allow setting:
  - Game size (`-s` or `--size`).
  - Theme (`-t` or `--theme`).
  - Fullscreen mode (`-f` or `--fullscreen`).
- Themes can be extended by modifying `snake/themes.py`.

### Performance and Scalability

- Designed for single-player, terminal-based play.
- Lightweight and performant for typical terminal sizes.
- Frame timing controlled via `config.frame_len` for smooth gameplay.

### Security Considerations

- No network or external input beyond keyboard.
- Runs locally; minimal security risks.
- Input sanitized by direct key code mapping.

### Monitoring and Observability

- No built-in monitoring or telemetry.
- Debugging via console output or adding logging as needed.
